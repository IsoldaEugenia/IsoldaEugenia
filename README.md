- 👋 Hi, I’m @IsoldaEugenia
- 👀 I’m interested in learning some Python, some Data Science, some Machine Learning, maybe neural networks? Right now, everything looks appealing to me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the above, and also trying to mix and match it with my research interests in my own field, actually I got a Masters and a PhD. on Pure Math.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to none/all/some of the above.
- 📫 How to reach me: just email me: isoldaec@gmail.com, or through Instagram @laiso2017, I also have a Discord user: Isolda#7475, and here is my work url https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~isolda/, I'm also on Spotify, Researchgate, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, but I don't recall my users nor my passwords for MSN and ICQ, hence they are not a practical way to reach me ;)
- Yes, that's me at the Chinese Wall, with my soccer team T-shirt (Rosario Central).
- The banner says "I defend public education", which I do. In my country anyone can study anything without paying a single dime. That's something to fight for, uh!
